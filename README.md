# -YGSIAC-
Youth gains sentience, intelligence, and compassion.
#rebirth update. 
 Pygame 2 is apparently a year old
 And so, I'm digging up YGSIAC from the cyber grave to update it to the new era.
This means:
* python 3
* a purpose to the actual game itself? 
* whole new code
* some other things I'll come up with later!
So, prior to the rebirth update coming soon, the game lacked direction and purpose,
being driven mostly by a frenzy to learn programming. Years later I return with a fresh perspective and ideas 
for my dearly beloved ygsiac...
Stay tuned.




#DEPRECATED
# This is the game project so far

# DONE:
 I suppose I should put some information up about how to actually play the demo.
 currently requires pygame 1.9.1, and python 2.7.
 why not python 3?
 cause i'm livin' in the stoneage like a caveman, back off!
### Arrow keys to walk, up to jump, S is currently "attack"
 
   * Title screen is navigated with the mouse. loading screen added, for effect.
   * splash screen, title screen, game state machine working well
   * map loading and parsing is working well, the rooms.py handles loading the tile data via a set of mapping functions in mapper.py, and acts as a mini state machine to swap between levels 
   * entities base class set up, with common functionality inherited to all of it's wonderful children.
   * items class coming along...
   * enemies were started...but I got sidetracked.    
   * CAMERA! the camera module I wrote so long ago lives again! 
   * the world is currently being meticulously crafted piece by piece out of dead pixels and binary heaps; it's coming along quite nicely.
   * a utilities module is made up with various scripts that help out around the house from time to time, good people, real good people.
   * going through major changes, most features being overhauled daily.
   * Player character now has a friend, N.I.M Bot which currently just flies around you!
   * start area being built now. 
   
## Next up(todo):
* make enemies
* add music
* add sound effects! holy butts, a game without sound is lame.
* finish scripting inventory system
* etc. etc. 
* ???
* finish game!
